## About me

I am a software programmer, actually living in **Lille, France**. Even though I'm not working actually in the video game industry, solving problems and team working are my everyday tasks.

I always loved the gaming universe, either be tabletop RPG, board game or video game. As such, I am currently putting my effort to work in this universe where I've grown up.
I participated in multiple gamejams and did multiple projects with problem solving in mind. I always loved to make systems, making a world alive.

**I'm searching to work in a video game company or to collaborate in gamejams or projects, so i can always learn new things.**
