## Tether'd Fate

Tether'd Fate was made in a team of 4 during the **GMTK 2021 GameJam**.
The project was done in 2 days.

The Brackeys GameJam 2021.1 had the theme "Joined Together". The little boy is joined with a ghost and they need to cooperate to go to the end of the level.
The physic is the main aspect of the game, as the ghost can make the boy fly on small distance. 
Even if the ghost is immune, there is danger ahead and the boy is not safe.

I worked on the main mechanics of the game.

**Unity** with C# was used.
