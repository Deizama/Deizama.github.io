## Robot Bounds

Robot Bounds was made alone during the **Brackeys GameJam 2021.1** (except the music).
The project was done in 2 weeks. As i was working the daytime, i could only make it in part-time.

The Brackeys GameJam 2021.1 had the theme "Stronger together", as such, you can switch between 3 characters.
Robot Bounds is heavily inspired by Celeste but got different mechanics depending on those characters.
Raka Jump farther, Bliss Jump higher and Yuno can redirect his jump mid-air, where the other two have to predict where they will land.

**Unity** with C# was used.
